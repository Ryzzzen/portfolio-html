I'm fond of TV shows, movies and musics (but I guess that's our generation, with such platforms like Netflix or Spotify that made this kind of stuff reachable.)",

  "description.section": "I've always been interested in computer science. Being a self-taught, I've taught myself programming languages to be able to succeed in different objectives I had given myself. When I was 13, I started playing with the Java programming language, to modify the well-known video-game called Minecraft. Then I started making projects in my corner, from static websites to dynamic websites, using libraries like jQuery. Recently I learned React (+ NextJS), a really good framework to my mind because when you know how to use it, you can make stuff pretty easily. I've also done desktop apps using C#, but more recently using Electron and NodeJS.",
